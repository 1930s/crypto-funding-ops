# A guide for funding opportunities in the crypto ecosystem
Taking inspiration from Nadia Eghbal's [Lemonade Stand](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand) and [Microgrants](https://github.com/nayafia/microgrants), this document aims to provide a list of all the ways people can get funded for crypto work who cannot/do not want to go the VC/ecosystem fund route or (admirably) the ICO route.

## Grants

### Ethereum Foundation 
https://app.tettra.co/teams/ethereum/pages/applying-for-ef-grants * official website coming soon

*The Ethereum Foundation grants have committed over $11M to over 52 projects since they kicked off their program at the start of 2018. They specifically fund projects that are committed to advancing the Ethereum ecosystem, which is a rather broad mandate. Preceding the funding of each wave, the EF [publishes a wish list](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/08/17/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-3/) for the types of projects that they hope to see apply.*

### Ethereum Community Fund
https://ecf.network/

*The Ethereum Community Fund is similar to the EF in that it wishes to advance the Ethereum ecosystem, however is backed by several founding members including Cosmos, OmiseGo, Maker, Golem, Web3 and Status. Typical grant amounts range from $10,000 to $100,000; in general, ECF will provide funding that will initially cover 6 months of runway. See previously funded ECF alumni [here](https://medium.com/ecf-review/meet-the-grantees-ecf-class-of-2018-part-ii-ff46a284a0b1). Interested parties can submit an application [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJoqPd1VeBLtmjUm4Cde_H12uFjS_a1HkSd8czRhDFCQJCPQ/viewform).*

### Protocol Labs Request For Proposals (RFP) Program
https://protocol.ai/blog/ann-research-rfp/

*The first RFPs solicit improvements to components used in Filecoin. Future RFPs will fund problems across PL's entire stack of protocols, from Multiformats to Filecoin, and they also welcome open problems and suggestions for work that they may be interested in funding. The RFP Program has an inital commitment of $5M to fund multiple rounds of grants ranging from $5,000 to $2M. Check out active RFPs [here](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs). Each RFP references an [Open Problem Statement](https://github.com/protocol/research/issues) in Protocol Labs' public research repo. Application instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/protocol/research-RFPs/blob/master/RFP-application-instructions.md).*

### Zcash Foundation Grants
https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/

*Zcash Foundation Grants are distributed twice annually and have a [broad scope](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/). See [here](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/wiki/Grant-Project-Ideas) for ideas. The foundation emphasizes that they are especially interested in funding proposals that are public goods and not obviously monetizable. The program had a 2017 Q4 budget of $80,000, funded by the Zcash Foundation, which they increased to $250,000 in 2018 Q2, funded by the Zcash Foundation and the Blockchain Institute.*

### Dash Budget Vote Proposal Tracker
https://dashnexus.org/leaderboard

*Dash has a large budget of $1M+ allocated monthly to this program (10% of Dash’s block rewards are earmarked for this program, decreasing by 7% roughly every year). A formal proposal costs 5 Dash to open ($1000 USD at today’s rate, destroyed upon receipt). The fee is meant to discourage spam; many proposals include fee reimbursement as part of their budget. Only “masternodes” can vote on Dash proposals. Masternodes are individuals who host “full” wallets in exchange for money, which have more functionality than a “regular” wallet, and require locking 1000 Dash ($200K USD) in their wallet. Reputation plays a big role in who gets funded: applicants are encouraged to build a relationship with the community, demonstrate that they’re the right person for the job, and drum up support for their proposal in the pre-proposal forum.*

*Proposals receive funding if “Net Votes” (total 'Yes' minus total 'No' votes) exceeds 10% of all active masternodes. Funding is prioritized based on higher net votes and the amount requested. However, winning-but-not-funded proposals can remain active for another monthly cycle, and may be funded then. While there are no formal accountability requirements, [Dash Watch](https://www.dashwatch.org/) was created to provide more insight and monitoring into funded proposals.*

### MakerDAO Core Community Development Group (CCDG)
https://medium.com/makerdao/announcing-the-makerdao-core-community-development-initiative-d388bfba88e3

*A series of initiatives (fund grants, bounties, community development rewards) designed to create direct incentives and support structures to allow people to participate in and contribute to the success the Dai Stable Coin platform.*

## Crowdfunding

### Monero Forum Funding System (FFS)
https://forum.getmonero.org/8/funding-required

*This could be classified as a "grant" but operates more as a crowdfunding mechanism. Anybody can propose an idea in the “Ideas” section, and the community is encouraged to discuss whether that idea would be valuable to work on. Successfully vetted ideas move to the next stage, “Open Tasks”, where anybody who’s interested in working on that idea can pitch themselves as the right person for the job. After a team is assigned to the proposal, it moves into the “Funding Required” stage, to raise funds for work. Like Kickstarter, this process is entirely crowdfunded: anybody can donate Monero towards these projects. After a proposal is funded, it moves to the “Work in Progress” stage. Funds are held in escrow and disbursed to the recipient as specific milestones are met. Grantees are expected to provide regular progress reports at this stage. Finally, after everything has been funded, and work has been completed, the proposal is archived in the “Completed Tasks” section.*

### Microgrants List

### Lightspeed Fellowship Program
https://lsvp.com/programs/summer-fellowship/

*Lightspeed grant around 20 Summer Fellowships each year to students or recent grads who are interested in starting a technology company over a summer. Each participant gets $15k and the team (minimum team of 2) gets an additional $5k.
