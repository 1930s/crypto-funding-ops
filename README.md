# A guide for funding opportunities in the crypto ecosystem
Taking inspiration from Nadia Eghbal's [Lemonade Stand](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand) and [Microgrants](https://github.com/nayafia/microgrants), this document aims to provide a list of all the ways people can get funded for crypto work who cannot/do not want to go the VC/ecosystem fund route or (admirably) the ICO route.

## Grants

### UNICEF Innovation Fund
http://unicefstories.org/blockchaincall/

*The UNICEF Innovation Fund is making $50-90K equity-free investments to provide seed financing to for-profit technology start-ups that have the potential to benefit humanity. The fund is looking to invest in a group of companies developing software solutions on open blockchains, specifically in the areas of smart contracts, analyzing data directly from public blockchains, tokenization and mining.

https://app.tettra.co/teams/ethereum/pages/applying-for-ef-grants * official website coming soon

*The Ethereum Foundation grants have committed over $11M to over 52 projects since they kicked off their program at the start of 2018. They fund projects that are committed to advancing the Ethereum ecosystem; a rather broad mandate covering public infrastructure and community goods. Preceding the funding of each wave, the EF [publishes a wish list](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/08/17/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-3/) for the types of projects that they hope to see apply.*

### Ethereum Community Fund
https://ecf.network/

*The Ethereum Community Fund is similar to the EF in that it wishes to advance the Ethereum ecosystem, however is backed by several founding members including Cosmos, OmiseGo, Maker, Golem, Web3 and Status. Typical grant amounts range from $10,000 to $100,000; in general, ECF will provide funding that will initially cover 6 months of runway. See previously funded ECF alumni [here](https://medium.com/ecf-review/meet-the-grantees-ecf-class-of-2018-part-ii-ff46a284a0b1).

Each RFP references an [Open Problem Statement](https://github.com/protocol/research/issues) in Protocol Labs' public research repo.
